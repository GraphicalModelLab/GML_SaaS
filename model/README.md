# Spark Job Application
This folder includes a set of example spark job applications for calculating a graph.
Actually, these spark job applications are also a part of plugin functionality.
So, it might be better to put these programs under "sample_plugin".
But, currently, we are putting these programs under this folder, "model".


## Directory

### 1. sample_model
This folder includes spark job application which can run through Spark Job Server.
And, these spark job applications are launched via ModelKernelDensityCSV and ModelMultivariateGuassianCSV plugins.
ModelKernelDensityCSV and ModelMultivariateGuassianCSV plugins are put within gmb core service, separately from sample_plugin folder.
